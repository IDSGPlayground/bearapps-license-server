Usage:

matlabout.py <name of db file from bearapps>
matlablistener.py

matlablistener opens a zmq subscriber socket on localhost:23272 which listens for
publishes starting with the word 'matlab' and will regenerate the matlab.opt file from
the bearapps database when the message is received. Once the file is generated, it
is checked into git, and then copied to /usr/local/matlab/etc,

Pre-requisites:

The /usr/local/matlab/src directory must exist and be a git repository.
The /usr/local/matlab/src/matlab.opt file must exist.
Depends on build-essential and python-dev.
Also depends on the pip packages gitpython and pyzmq.
